<h1>Big Int - Integer Calculator for Any Size</h1>

The BigInt program is designed to handle the arithmetic operations of large integers, exceeding the limitations of the standard long long int in C++ (recall that in C++ the number of digits a long long int can have is a maximum of 20). This custom data type, BigInt, can accommodate numbers with 22 digits or more by utilizing a vector-based data structure. 

<h2>Features</h2>

- <b>Arithmetic Operations:</b> Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/), Modulus (%).
- <b>Comparison Operators:</b> Less than (<), Greater than (>), Equal to (==).
- <b>Handle Gigantic Integer Values:</b> The program can handle integers with more than 20 digits, making it suitable for applications requiring large numerical calculations.
